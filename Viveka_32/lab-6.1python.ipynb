Store each user and password in one line. File Processing: Write a program that opens your “loginfile.txt” file and reads usernames and passwords from it. Store user names in one list and passwords in another lists. Querying: ask user to enter user name 3 and password for verification. If they match the values stored in the lists, print a message “Login Successful”. Otherwise print a message “Login Failed, try again”."
